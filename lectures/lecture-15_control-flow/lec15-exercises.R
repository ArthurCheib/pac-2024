## Exercise 1: Basic if statement
# Write an if statement that checks if a number is even. If it is, print "The number is even."
# Hint: You might need to research about the `%%` operator

number <- 42


## Exercise 2: if-else statement
# Expand the previous exercise with an else statement to handle odd numbers, printing "The number is odd."

number <- 43


## Exercise 3: Nested if-else
# Use a nested if-else statement to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero and print the result.

number <- -5


## Exercise 4: if_else function with vectors
# Use the if_else() function to replace all negative values in a vector with NA and print the result.

values <- c(-10, 0, 10, -20, 30)



## Exercise 5: Categorize life expectancy with if_else
# Using the gapminder dataset for the year 2007, categorize countries into "High" or "Low" life expectancy groups based on a threshold (e.g., 65 years), then print the first few rows of the result.
