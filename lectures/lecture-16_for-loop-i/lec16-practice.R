## Exercise 1: Basic for loop with numbers
# Use a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, printing each number multiplied by 2.


## Exercise 2: for loop with a vector
# write a for loop to print the name of each of the countries in the vector below
countries <- c("Brazil", "Sweden", "Japan", "Canada", "Nigeria")

## Exercise 3: Conditional inside a for loop
# Use a for loop to iterate over numbers 1 to 10. For each number, print whether it is odd or even.

## Exercise 4: Summation with a for loop
# Initialize a variable to store the sum (start at 0).
# Use a for loop to add numbers 1 through 10 to this sum. Print the final sum after the loop.


## Exercise 5: Applying a for loop to gapminder data
# For each country in the gapminder dataset, for the year 2007 calculate the average life expectancy 
# and print it. Use a for loop to iterate through unique country names.
# Hint: You may first need to filter the dataset for the year 2007 and find unique country names
