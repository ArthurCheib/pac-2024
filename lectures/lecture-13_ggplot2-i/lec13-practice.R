## Libraries you will need
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)

## Exercise 1: Basic ggplot graph
# Create a basic ggplot scatter plot using the gapminder dataset for a country of your choice,
# displaying its GDP per capita over the years.
# Use geom_point() for the plot. Make sure to label your axes appropriately.

## Exercise 2: Enhance the plot with color
# Modify the previous plot to color the points based on the continent. Also, adjust the point size to 3.


## Exercise 3: Add a smoother
# Using the same plot from Exercise 2, add a smooth line to estimate trends. 
# Hint: Use `geom_smooth()`


## Exercise 4: Custom themes
# For any plot of your choice from the previous exercises, apply a custom theme using theme_minimal()
# and customize the text of the title and axes.
