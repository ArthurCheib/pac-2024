## Exercise 1: Basic leaflet map
# Create a basic leaflet map with default tiles and set the view to a location of your choice
# Remember to use lat/long coordinates
# Suggestion: get the lat/long pair of the city where you were born


## Exercise 2: Add a marker to your map
# To the map created in Exercise 1, add a marker at the same location you chose.
# Include a popup with the name of the location.


## Exercise 3: Use a different tile layer
# Modify the map from Exercise 1 by using a different tile layer.
# Choose one from the set of available tiles in the leaflet package (e.g., Stamen Watercolor).


## Exercise 4: Add circle markers for multiple locations
# Create a map that includes circle markers for at least three different locations of your choice.
# Customize the color and radius of the circles. Include popups with information about each location.
