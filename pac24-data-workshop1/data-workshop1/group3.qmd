## Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# General Feedback:
# - The script is very well-structured and looking good!

# All good here!
library(tidyverse)

# All good here!
mortality <- read_csv("raw-datasets/5-wb-mortality_rate_under5.csv")
electricty <- read_csv("raw-datasets/6-wb-access_eletricity.csv", skip = 4)

# All almost good here!
# Suggestion 1: breaking the lines for readability
mortality <- mortality %>% select(-country_name)

# Good use of the line breaker here and the : operator
new_mortality <- mortality %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = yr_1960:yr_2023,
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "Mortality"
  )

new_electricity <- electricty %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `1960`:`2023`,
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "Percent"
  )

# All good here!
write_csv(new_mortality, "clean-datasets/clean_mortality.csv")
write_csv(new_electricity, "clean-datasets/clean_electricity.csv")
```
